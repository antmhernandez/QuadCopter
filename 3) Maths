Motor Servos take 0 - 180
Joysticks output 0 - 1023, with 512 at 'center'

Drone Motors:
  FL      FR

  BL      BR


Joystick Outputs:
  Throttle: 0 - 1023
w Yaw:      0 - 1023

x Pitch:    0 - 1023
y Roll:     0 - 1023

For example, a joystick command to give:
JS1:  Full Throttle  (1023)
      0 Yaw          (512)
JS2:  Full Right     (1023)
      Full Forward   (1023)
For values T, Y, P, R,

  FL                          FR
1023-512 = 511 -> 180?
512-512 = 0 -> 0



"Dead Zone": Create 'senseless' region for thumb, more for throttle, less for yaw
    Dead Yaw: 500 - 524
    Dead Throttle: 475 - 550

Auto-Balance: record total displacements x, y, z.
    When Pitch/Roll Joystick is in "dead zone", apply motor power to undo net angular displacement.
    Must account for offset Center of Gravity
Trim Function:
    Add trim function to self balance:
        Self-Balance Trim must store values to trim in x, y, z angular directions.
    Add button to manually trim. How to interact with auto-balance/trim?
Auto-kill a wild gyroscope. Sometimes, after quick change, it continues to increase wildly.

Limit Pitch and Roll:
    Use gyroscope to record angular displacement. Limit to set max angular displacement in x, y, z
    Use proportion to convert joystick value to acceptable range
