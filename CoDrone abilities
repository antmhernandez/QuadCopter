CoDrone.pair();
CoDrone.takeoff(); //goes up and hovers for 3 seconds
CoDrone.hover(# of sec); 
  CoDrone.land(); //lands the CoDrone 
CoDrone.emergencyStop(); // use with if statements with bytes typed in with the parameters of the if statement 

movement

CoDrone.setRoll(0);+right - left
CoDrone.setPitch(0); - backwards + forwards
CoDrone.setYaw(0); +clockwise - counterclockwise
CoDrone.Throttle(0); +up -down
num in () is speed must say CoDrone.move(); number in the () is for time in sec

remote thingys

CoDrone.Buzz(tone, length);makes noise
must use byte for IR sensors

timers 
millis(); milliseconds
micros(); microseconds
